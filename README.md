# CSC305-Final-Project
My final project for CSC305 at the University of Rhode Island in the spring of 2015.

Introduction:

This is my final project for CSC305: Software Engineering.  This was a project class, and my partner for this project was Steven Bowder.  Also, a lot of help came from the TA for that class, David Iacono.  They deserve a huge amount of credit in this project.  

At URI, Software Engineering is something of a technical writing class, focusing on the deliverable artifacts of waterfall development.  So, we have:

  A requirements document (called ReqFinal.docx)
  A requirements matrix (called ReqMatrix.xlsx)
  A design document (called DesFinal.docx)
  A test plan (called TestPlan.docx)
  Our Final Presentation (called ShortCuts Presentation.pptx)
  A note to our professor (called SUBMISSION README.txt)
  The program itself (within Shortcuts.zip)
  
As for the program itself, it's a customer relationship management application for android phones and tablets for barbers and hairdressers to take pictures of their clients and relate them to a database on the device for future reference.  We called it ShortCuts.

The ShortCuts.zip file is the program itself.  Because the class was focused on the deliverables and not the program, it is more of a proof-of-concept than a working applications.  It can also be found here:  https://github.com/ShortCutsURI/ShortCuts

HOW TO RUN OUR CODE:

1. Download AndroidStudio SDK. 
(Download from: https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

2. Install AndroidStudio. 

3. Download and install SDK for API 15 (4.0.3).
* If not installed with initial AndroidStudio installation, SDK can be downloaded from the SDK Manager (Tools -> Android -> SDK Manager).

4. Extract ShortCuts.zip to a working location. (ex. Desktop)

5. Import ShortCuts project into AndroidStudio. (File -> Import Project -> Navigate to ShortCuts directory, i.e. C:\Users\Steve\Desktop)

6. Java files are located under app -> com.shortcut.steve.shortcuts, while XML files are located under app -> res -> layout.
