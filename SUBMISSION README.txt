FORMATTING GLITCHES FYI:

There are a few weird formatting glitches that appear in some of the documents that reappear every time I open them.  I've fixed them multiple times but they refuse to save.  They include:

Presentation: SWOT Table
Reqs Doc: Table of Contents (minorly)
Design Doc: Table of Contents, intendation of 2.4

So, just be aware of that when you review them.

WHERE TO GET OUR CODE:

https://github.com/ShortCutsURI/ShortCuts

The github should work, but if it gets fussy (as it seems to like to do), I also have a copy of it as a zip file in the google docs.  Email me if you need it.

HOW TO RUN OUR CODE:

1. Download AndroidStudio SDK. 
(Download from: https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html)

2. Install AndroidStudio. 

3. Download and install SDK for API 15 (4.0.3).
* If not installed with initial AndroidStudio installation, SDK can be downloaded from the SDK Manager (Tools -> Android -> SDK Manager).

4. Extract ShortCuts.zip to a working location. (ex. Desktop)

5. Import ShortCuts project into AndroidStudio. (File -> Import Project -> Navigate to ShortCuts directory, i.e. C:\Users\Steve\Desktop)

6. Java files are located under app -> com.shortcut.steve.shortcuts, while XML files are located under app -> res -> layout.
